Bazel build system (github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/) packaged as an SDK extension.
Current manifest just downloads pre-built binaries from GitHub.
If you're on an architecture other than x86_64 or arm64, have a look in org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.bazel.yaml.old -- it contains some half-baked build instructions which you might be able to use.

To build things using bazel, add the following to your manifest file:

	add-build-extensions:
	  - org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.bazel
	build-options:
	  append-path: /usr/lib/sdk/bazel/bin

You might also need to add the following to your module if bazel wants to download some dependencies of its own:

	build-options:
	  build-args:
		- --share=network
